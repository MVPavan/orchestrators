## Files Updated

- `.claude/project/brief.md`
- `.claude/project/components.md` *(since removed from the overlay)*
- `.claude/project/verification.md`
- `.claude/project/invariants.md`
- `.claude/project/docs-index.md`
- `.claude/project/learnings.md`
- `.claude/project/adoption-report.md`

## Assumptions

- The eventual Bodha implementation remains Python-first and async, based on the authoritative v2.7 design docs.
- All paths in this overlay are repo-relative to the Bodha project root.
- The v2.7 design set supersedes the older v2.2-era harness whenever they conflict.

## Conflicts or Gaps

- Current repo reality is docs-first: no source tree, manifests, CI config, or test directories were found. Infrastructure setup exists under `infra/proxy-setup/`.
- The old setup encodes stale v2.2 assumptions that conflict with v2.7, including `async_core.Scheduler`, OmegaConf-based config guidance, and the older Dhī boundary.
- The v2.7 design docs live under `docs/design/v_2_7/core/`, while supporting discussion docs live under `docs/design/v_2_6/core/new_discussions/`.
- Because repo-native verification commands do not exist yet, the adopted verification surface is limited to doc-consistency checks plus explicit future Python fallback.

## Next Review Step

- Human review required before treating the setup as fully adopted.
- When Bodha source lands, replace doc-only verification with repo-native commands and promote code-level invariants from design intent into mechanically checkable checks.
