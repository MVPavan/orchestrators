# Planning

This skill turns approved requirements into an execution-ready plan.

## Workflow

1. Start from approved requirements or explicit assumptions.
2. If product behavior is still unclear, return to brainstorming.
3. Research local code, tests, project docs, and prior learnings before fixing the plan shape.
4. Write a right-sized plan at the caller-specified path. For phase work, use
   `docs/workstreams/<name>/plans/<phase>.md`; for cross-cutting standalone plans, use `docs/plans/`.
5. Include:
   - goal and scope
   - origin doc or assumptions
   - repo-relative create/modify/test paths
   - risks, invariants, and verification
   - the smallest tracer-bullet step that proves the path
6. For risky behavior changes, call out test-first or characterization-first execution.
7. Critique risky plans before finalizing:
   - In Codex, use `$use-codex` to choose a direct critique path such as `codex exec "Critique this plan for scope gaps, ordering issues, missing test coverage, and design-doc misalignment: <plan summary>"`.
   - Do not use working-tree review commands for plan documents; those operate on git diffs, not plan text.
8. Hand the plan to subagent-driven development or direct execution, depending on scope.

## Rules

- Keep the plan portable and repo-relative.
- Do not pre-write large code blocks or shell choreography.
- Make tasks small enough to verify independently.
