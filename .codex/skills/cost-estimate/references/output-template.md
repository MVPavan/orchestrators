# Output Template

Use this template to structure the final cost estimate report. Replace all `[bracketed]`
placeholders with calculated values. Remove any sections that don't apply (e.g., skip
the AI assistant ROI section if the project wasn't AI-assisted).

### Assumptions & Exclusions

**Assumptions**:
1. Rates based on US market averages ([current year])
2. Full-time equivalent allocation for all roles
3. Includes complete implementation of all analyzed features
4. Senior developer (5+ years experience) as baseline

**Not Included**:
- Marketing & sales
- Legal & compliance
- Office space / equipment

### Confidence & Caveats

**Confidence Level**: [High / Medium / Low]

**Key Uncertainties**:
- [List any factors that could significantly shift the estimate]
- [Note areas where complexity is hard to assess from code alone]

**Recommendation**: [Any advice — e.g., "For budgeting purposes, use the Growth Company
scenario at average rates as your baseline, and add 15–20% contingency."]
